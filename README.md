**Risk Factor Analysis for Identifying Fraudulent Firms**

**Data Set Information:**

This dataset is taken from a research explained here.

The goal of the research is to help the auditors by building a classification model that can predict the fraudulent firm on the basis the present and historical risk factors. The information about the sectors and the counts of firms are listed respectively as Irrigation (114), Public Health (77), Buildings and Roads (82), Forest (70), Corporate (47), Animal Husbandry (95), Communication (1), Electrical (4), Land (5), Science and Technology (3), Tourism (1), Fisheries (41), Industries (37), Agriculture (200).

**Key Observations:**

**Score Metrics:**

**SECTOR_SCORE:** Mean of approximately 19.79 with a high standard deviation (24.16), indicating a wide range of sector scores.

**SCORE_A and SCORE_B:** Mean values are 3.53 and 3.14, respectively. Both have relatively lower standard deviations compared to SECTOR_SCORE, suggesting less variability. Risk Metrics:

RISK_A, RISK_B, RISK_C, RISK_D, RISK_E, RISK_F: These metrics have relatively low mean values and low variability. The maximum values are much higher than the 75th percentile values, indicating that high-risk values are rare but significant. 

**Financial and Loss Metrics:**

**MONEY_VALUE and DISTRICT_LOSS:** These have large ranges and high mean values, suggesting significant financial impact and loss. TOTAL: Mean is 11.54 with a wide range, indicating variability in the total metric.

**Probabilities:**

**PROB1 and PROB:** The mean values are low with very low variability, suggesting that the probabilities are generally low and consistent.

**Trends and Insights:**

**High Variability in Scores:**

SECTOR_SCORE exhibits high variability, implying that sector scores can vary significantly across different entries. This could indicate differences in sector performance or reporting.

**Consistency in Risk Metrics:**

The risk metrics (A through F) show that most entries have low risk values, with significant outliers. This might suggest that while most entities face low risk, there are a few that experience high risk.

**Large Financial Impacts:**

The wide range and high mean values for financial metrics like MONEY_VALUE and DISTRICT_LOSS suggest that financial losses can be substantial and vary greatly.

**Probabilities Are Low:**

PROB1 and PROB are generally low and consistent, indicating that the likelihood of certain events or outcomes is minimal across the dataset.

**Potential Outliers:**

SECTOR_SCORE, MONEY_VALUE, and DISTRICT_LOSS have high maximum values compared to their 75th percentile values, indicating the presence of significant outliers.

**Central Tendencies and Dispersions:**

SCORE_A and SCORE_B have relatively lower variability compared to SECTOR_SCORE, suggesting that these scores are more stable across the dataset.

**Possible Actions:**

**Further Analysis:** Investigate the entities or cases with extreme values in SECTOR_SCORE, MONEY_VALUE, and DISTRICT_LOSS to understand the reasons behind these outliers.

**Risk Management:** Analyze the distribution of risk metrics to develop targeted strategies for managing high-risk cases.

**Financial Planning:** Use the variability in financial metrics to forecast and prepare for potential large losses.
